## Quick Start

To get it running, follow the steps below:

## 1. Setup dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i
```

## 2. Setup env using Infisical

1. Install the Infisical CLI on your machine using [these instructions](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/overview).

2. Login to infisical to access the env

```bash
$ infisical login

# Select Self Hosting
# Enter the following domain: https://env.connectalum.dev/
```

3. Now, any commands that require access to the env will work!

> **NOTE:** If you're getting permission denied errors, please reach out to Ethan to get access to our env!

## 3. Expo environment dependencies

### Use iOS Simulator (MacOS only)

Make sure you have XCode and XCommand Line Tools installed [as shown on expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator).

> **NOTE:** If you just installed XCode, or if you have updated it, you need to open the simulator manually once. Run `npx expo start` from `apps/expo`, and then enter `I` to launch Expo Go. After the manual launch, you can run `pnpm dev` in the root directory.

### Use Android Emulator

Install Android Studio tools [as shown on expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator).

## 4. Setting up Supabase

1. Go to the [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/projects) and create a new project.
2. Under project settings, retrieve the environment variables `reference id`, `project url` & `anon public key` and set them up in Infisical (L3s have permission for this). See the `env.ts` file for the env schema.
3. Under `Auth`, configure any auth provider(s) of your choice. This repo is using email/password and Apple for Mobile.
4. Under `Auth` -> `URL Configuration`, set the `Site URL` to your production URL and add `http://localhost:3000/**` and `https://*-username.vercel.app/**` to `Redirect URLs` as detailed here <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls#vercel-preview-urls>.
5. Download the SSL certificate from Supabase. Open the file that it downloads in Notepad or your IDE and then populate the `DATABASE_CA` environment variable with the text.
![404548288-f1bc1c43-6455-44cc-b06e-7082ed4563f5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ea8419-0913-43a4-89aa-3d128d81cca1)

Your environment variable should look something like this:
```
DATABASE_CA="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIFfjCCA2agAwIBAgIUFzt/hG+Kx2L1z9uzChgojfS2lcQwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL
[...]
RF9269bOFWLNGVRYXAj9XdE7
-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
```
   
6. Set up a trigger when a new user signs up: <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/managing-user-data#using-triggers>. Can run this in the SQL Editor.

```sql
create function public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer set search_path = ''
as $$
begin
  insert into public.users (id, email, emailVerified)
  values (new.id, new.email, raw_user_meta_data ->> 'emailVerified');
  return new;
end;
$$;

-- trigger the function every time a user is created
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();

-- trigger the function when a user signs in/their email is confirmed to get missing values
create trigger on_auth_user_verified
  after update on auth.users
  for each row when (
    old.last_sign_in_at is null
    and new.last_sign_in_at is not null
  ) execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
```

```sql
-- drop a trigger if needed
drop trigger "on_auth_user_verified" on auth.users;
```

7. Remove access to the `public` schema as we are only using the server

By default, Supabase exposes the `public` schema to the PostgREST API to allow the `supabase-js` client query the database directly from the client. However, since we route all our requests through the Next.js application (through tRPC), we don't want our client to have this access. To disable this, execute the following SQL query in the SQL Editor on your Supabase dashboard:

![disable public access](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51714798/231810706-88b1db82-0cfd-485f-9043-ef12a53dc62f.png)

```sql
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM anon, authenticated;
```

## 5a. When it's time to add a new UI component

Run the `ui-add` script to add a new UI component using the interactive `shadcn/ui` CLI:

```bash
pnpm ui-add
```

When the component(s) has been installed, you should be good to go and start using it in your app.

## 5b. When it's time to add a new package

To add a new package, simply run `pnpm turbo gen init` in the monorepo root. This will prompt you for a package name as well as if you want to install any dependencies to the new package (of course you can also do this yourself later).

The generator sets up the `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` and a `index.ts`, as well as configures all the necessary configurations for tooling around your package such as formatting, linting and typechecking. When the package is created, you're ready to go build out the package.

### Does this pattern leak backend code to my client applications?

No, it does not. The `api` package should only be a production dependency in the Next.js application where it's served. The Expo app, and all other apps you may add in the future, should only add the `api` package as a dev dependency. This lets you have full typesafety in your client applications, while keeping your backend code safe.

If you need to share runtime code between the client and server, such as input validation schemas, you can create a separate `shared` package for this and import it on both sides.

## 6a. Deploying Auth Proxy

The auth proxy is a Nitro server that proxies OAuth requests in preview deployments. This is required for the Next.js app to be able to authenticate users in preview deployments. The auth proxy is not used for OAuth requests in production deployments. To get it running, it's easiest to use Vercel Edge functions. See the [Nitro docs](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/vercel#vercel-edge-functions) for how to deploy Nitro to Vercel.

Then, there are some environment variables you need to set in order to get OAuth working:

- For the Next.js app, set `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` to the URL of the auth proxy.
- For the auth proxy server, set `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` to the same as above, as well as `AUTH_DISCORD_ID`, `AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET` (or the equivalent for your OAuth provider(s)). Lastly, set `AUTH_SECRET` **to the same value as in the Next.js app** for preview environments.

Read more about the setup in [the auth proxy README](./apps/auth-proxy/README.md).

## 6b. Deploying Expo

Deploying your Expo application works slightly differently compared to Next.js on the web. Instead of "deploying" your app online, you need to submit production builds of your app to app stores, like [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps). You can read the full [guide to distributing your app](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction), including best practices, in the Expo docs.

1. Make sure to modify the `getBaseUrl` function to point to your backend's production URL:

   <https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/656965aff7db271e5e080242c4a3ce4dad5d25f8/apps/expo/src/utils/api.tsx#L20-L37>

2. Let's start by setting up [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction), which is short for Expo Application Services. The build service helps you create builds of your app, without requiring a full native development setup. The commands below are a summary of [Creating your first build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup).

   ```bash
   # Install the EAS CLI
   pnpm add -g eas-cli

   # Log in with your Expo account
   eas login

   # Configure your Expo app
   cd apps/expo
   eas build:configure
   ```

3. After the initial setup, you can create your first build. You can build for Android and iOS platforms and use different [`eas.json` build profiles](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/eas-json) to create production builds or development, or test builds. Let's make a production build for iOS.

   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

   > If you don't specify the `--profile` flag, EAS uses the `production` profile by default.

4. Now that you have your first production build, you can submit this to the stores. [EAS Submit](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/introduction) can help you send the build to the stores.

   ```bash
   eas submit --platform ios --latest
   ```

   > You can also combine build and submit in a single command, using `eas build ... --auto-submit`.

5. Before you can get your app in the hands of your users, you'll have to provide additional information to the app stores. This includes screenshots, app information, privacy policies, etc. _While still in preview_, [EAS Metadata](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/metadata) can help you with most of this information.

6. Once everything is approved, your users can finally enjoy your app. Let's say you spotted a small typo; you'll have to create a new build, submit it to the stores, and wait for approval before you can resolve this issue. In these cases, you can use EAS Update to quickly send a small bugfix to your users without going through this long process. Let's start by setting up EAS Update.

   The steps below summarize the [Getting started with EAS Update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/getting-started/#configure-your-project) guide.

   ```bash
   # Add the `expo-updates` library to your Expo app
   cd apps/expo
   pnpm expo install expo-updates

   # Configure EAS Update
   eas update:configure
   ```

7. Before we can send out updates to your app, you have to create a new build and submit it to the app stores. For every change that includes native APIs, you have to rebuild the app and submit the update to the app stores. See steps 2 and 3.

8. Now that everything is ready for updates, let's create a new update for `production` builds. With the `--auto` flag, EAS Update uses your current git branch name and commit message for this update. See [How EAS Update works](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/how-eas-update-works/#publishing-an-update) for more information.

   ```bash
   cd apps/expo
   eas update --auto
   ```

   > Your OTA (Over The Air) updates must always follow the app store's rules. You can't change your app's primary functionality without getting app store approval. But this is a fast way to update your app for minor changes and bug fixes.

9. Done! Now that you have created your production build, submitted it to the stores, and installed EAS Update, you are ready for anything!

**iOS:** One of the requirements for Apple's review process requires you to implement native `Sign in with Apple` if you're providing any other third party authentication method. Read more in [Section 4.8 - Design: Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple).

This is preconfigured and you can find it [here](./apps/expo/src/utils/auth.ts). All you need to do is to enable the Apple Provider in your [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com) and fill in your information.

## 7. Configure Expo `dev`-script

### iOS Simulator

1. Make sure you have XCode and XCommand Line Tools installed [as shown on expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/).
   > **NOTE:** If you just installed XCode, or if you have updated it, you need to open the simulator manually once. Run `npx expo start` in the root dir, and then enter `I` to launch Expo Go. After the manual launch, you can run `pnpm dev` in the root directory.

```diff
+  "dev": "expo start --ios",
```

3. Run `pnpm dev` at the project root folder.

> **TIP:** It might be easier to run each app in separate terminal windows so you get the logs from each app separately. This is also required if you want your terminals to be interactive, e.g. to access the Expo QR code. You can run `pnpm --filter expo dev` and `pnpm --filter nextjs dev` to run each app in a separate terminal window.

### Android Studio

1. Install Android Studio tools [as shown on expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).
2. Change the `dev` script at `apps/expo/package.json` to open the Android emulator.

```diff
"dev": "expo start --android",
```

3. Run `pnpm dev` at the project root folder.
